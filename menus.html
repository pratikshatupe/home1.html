    <p> " India's star paneer dish is definitely the paneer tikka. Many believe it was invented in the 1960s at Delhi's Ranjit Hotel. Since then, any restaurant with a tandoor makes sure to put it on the menu. Some restaurants even go as far as putting it on pizzas, making paneer tikka pizza a popular dish in some regions."</p>
